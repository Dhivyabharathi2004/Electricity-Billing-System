Electricity Billing System is a software-based application.
i. This project aims at serving the department of electricity by 
computerizing the billing system.
ii. It mainly focuses on the calculation of units consumed during the 
specified time and the money to be charged by the electricity offices.
iii. This computerized system will make the overall billing system easy, 
accessible, comfortable, and effective for consumers.
To design the billing system more service oriented and simple, the following 
features have been implemented in the project. The application has high speed 
of performance with accuracy and efficiency.
The software provides facility of data sharing, it does not require any staff as 
in the conventional system. Once it is installed on the system only the meter 
readings are to be given by the admin where customer can view all details, it 
has the provision of security restriction.
The electricity billing software calculates the units consumed by the 
customer and makes bills, it requires small storage for installation and 
functioning. There is provision for debugging if any problem is encountered in 
the system.
The system excludes the need of maintaining paper electricity bill, 
administrator does not have to keep a manual track of the users, users can pay 
the amount without visiting the office. Thus, it saves human efforts and 
resources.

The firm handles all the work manually, which is very tedious and 
mismatched.
The objectives of our project are as follows:
 To keep the information of consuming unit energy of current 
month.
 To keep the information of Customer.
 To keep the information of consuming unit energy of 
previous month.
 To calculate the units consumed every month regularly.
 To generate the bills adding penalty and rent.
 To save the time by implementing payment process online.
1.2 Problem Statement
The manual system is suffering from a series of drawbacks. Since whole 
of the bills is to be maintained with hands the process of keeping and 
maintaining the information is very tedious and lengthy to customer. It is very 
time consuming and laborious process because, staff need to be visited the 
customers place every month to give the bills and to receive the payments. For 
this reason, we have provided features Present system is partially automated 
(computerized), existing system is quite laborious as one must enter same 
information at different places.
1.3 Proposed Solution
o This project system excludes the need of maintaining paper electricity 
bill as all the electricity bill records are managed electronically.
o Administrator doesn't have to keep a manual track of the users. The 
system automatically calculates the fine.
o Users don't have to visit to the office for bill payment.
o There is no need of delivery boy for delivery bills to user's 
place.
o Thus, it saves human efforts and resources
